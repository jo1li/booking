7. Opus is a Marketplace; Limitation of Liability

Opus acts as a marketplace to connect musicians (each, a “Musician” and collectively, the “Musicians”) and event planners (including, without limitation, hosts, event hosts, event organizers, and the like)  (each, an “Event Host” and collectively, the “Event Hosts”) for the purpose of working together. You acknowledge and agree that Opus is not a party to any agreement between you and a Musician or Event Host, and that we are not liable to you for any loss incurred as the result of a Musician’s or Event Host’s acts or omissions, including without limitation failure to fulfill an order, failure to communicate, breach of contract, conversion, fraud, negligence, and intellectual property violations.

You acknowledge and agree that Opus does not necessarily have control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of any Musician’s or Event Host’s services, the truth or accuracy of any Musician or Event Host statements, or the ability of Musicians or Event Hosts to fulfill their obligations under an agreement with you. Opus cannot ensure that a Musician or Event Host will actually complete a transaction or follow through on their promises.

Opus cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a Musician or Event Host. Opus encourages you to communicate directly with Musicians and Event Hosts through the tools available on the Service.

If you are an Event Host, and you plan to serve alcohol at an event featured on the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring that all attendees are age 21 or older, and that attendees drink responsibly. You agree to indemnify Opus for any damages resulting from your failure to do so, in accordance with Sections 19 and 20 of this Terms of Use.

8. You Bear Risk of Upload. Opus uses reasonable security measures in order to attempt to protect any content or information that you upload, including without limitation any information, photographs or other images, or intellectual property, or any meta-data resulting therefrom (collectively, “Your Content”). However, Opus cannot guarantee that there will be no unauthorized copying or distribution of Your Content nor will Opus be liable for any copying or usage of Your Content not authorized by Opus. You hereby release and forever waive any claims you may have against Opus for any such unauthorized copying or usage of Your Content, under any theory of liability. THE SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT YOUR CONTENT USED BY OPUS HEREIN ARE PROVIDED AND USED "AS-IS" AND WITH NO WARRANTIES OR ASSURANCES THAT SUCH SECURITY MEASURES WILL WITHSTAND ATTEMPTS TO EVADE SECURITY MECHANISMS OR THAT THERE WILL BE NO CRACKS, DISABLEMENTS OR OTHER CIRCUMVENTION OF SUCH SECURITY MEASURES.

9. Membership; Pricing; Charges on Your Account.

a. General. You may become a free Member of the Service at no cost. As a free Member, you will have the ability to participate in some, but not all, of the features and services available within the Service. In order to access additional features and services, you must become a paying member of the Service. Please note that the billing policies that are disclosed to you in subscribing to the service are deemed part of this Terms of Use. Notwithstanding anything herein, you are solely responsible for all taxes associated with your use of the Service.
b. Billing. Opus bills you through an online account (your "Billing Account") for use of the Service. You agree to pay Opus all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Service, as well as any transactions therefor, by you or other persons (including your agents) using your Billing Account, and you authorize Opus to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method") for the Service. You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. Opus reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.
c. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.
d. Recurring Billing. Our subscription plans to the Service consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that your subscription has an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. Opus may submit periodic charges (e.g. monthly) without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice (confirmed in writing by Opus) that you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your Payment Method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before Opus could reasonably act. You may cancel your paid membership or change your payment information by emailing us at support@opusapps.co. For your convenience, we take your payment information so that your Opus membership will not be interrupted. We auto-renew your membership at the level you selected. Your Opus subscription will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate (if applicable). To cancel, simply log into your account and follow the instructions for cancellation; alternatively, you may send us an email at support@opusapps.co. Please note that you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.

CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT BY EMAILING US AT SUPPORT@OPUSAPPS.CO. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE OPUS ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT OPUS MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF THE SERVICE UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE SERVICE (CONFIRMED BY YOU IN WRITING UPON REQUEST BY OPUS).
f. Payment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method.
g. Reaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Opus is authorized to charge your Payment Method. Opus may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive Opus’s right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially subscribed to the Service.
h. Free Trial; Promotion. We may provide a free trial or other promotion (the "Promotion"), which Promotion may provide you access to some or all features afforded to paying members of the Service.

25. Arbitration Provision/No Class Action. Except where prohibited by law, as a condition of using the Service, you agree that any and all disputes, claims and causes of action (collectively, "Claim") arising out of or connected with the Service, shall be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, exclusively by binding arbitration for full and final settlement of such Claim, and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties shall split the arbitration and/or mediator costs. An award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered and confirmed by the courts of the State of New Jersey, County of Hudson, or the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The parties agree that any post-arbitration action seeking to enforce an arbitration award or action seeking equitable or injunctive relief shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of New Jersey, County of Hudson, or the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.
